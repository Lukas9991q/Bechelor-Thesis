# Bechelor-Thesis
The aim of the project was to build a monitoring and tracking camera capable of monitoring and tracking objects in real-time, with the ability to select one of several objects for tracking. The system enables tracking of multiple objects simultaneously, with the camera's rotation capabilities reaching up to 360 degrees horizontally and 180 degrees vertically. Two stepper motors are responsible for driving the motors, ensuring smooth and quiet camera rotations. The system's housing was constructed using 3D printing technology.
